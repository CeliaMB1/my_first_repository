keep file paths short and sensible

no fun characters or spaces in titles pls

Always pull before you start working on your project
and before you push in case someone has done any work
since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s
work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts

Thank you!!
